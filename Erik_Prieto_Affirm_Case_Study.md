** How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? **

Max Levchin, previously a cofounder of Paypal, had been struggling with garnering a viable fintech company after the exit sale of his prior company (Slide was sold to Google for $200M). He believed fintech was dead in 2010 whenever he conversed with Peter Theil (also a Paypal cofounder). Alas, Max was convinced that there was opportunity when a friend explained that current lending leaders, Lending Club and SoFi, were most likely winning by cutting costs – the companies were not identifying better consumers that were unlikely to default. Max would center his company around identifying more consumers to lend to and further developed his model:

The company was started to create more transparency to the consumer. Rather than dictating compound-interest and late fee terms, Affirm does not charge for late fees and offers multiple 0% APR products. Affirm offers 0% APR loans as well as simple-interest loans. Affirm makes the majority of its revenue by taking a cut of the merchant’s end of the transaction. The merchant benefits by having more transactions occur and belief that the risk-modeling of Affirm can identify those additional consumers at an appropriate risk. All of its loans are originated by its bank partner, Cross River Bank. 

Overall, Affirm is part of the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) trend. The trend is particularly popular overseas while there is limited share in the U.S.

## Business Activities:

** What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? **

** Affirm address several financial problems within the lending section. **
1. Risk-Modeling

Merchants and lenders are limited in loan origination scope by the data that they have. Affirm models its risk by taking data from the transaction level. By doing so, Affirm is able to identify more consumers, which enables more transactions that the merchant benefits from.
2. Consumer transparency  

Affirm chooses to provide transparency to the consumer by offering the full costs upfront and Affirm will also not charge late fees – essentially enabling a flexible payment plan.

3. Ease of access 

Affirm provides access of its loans through partnerships with the merchants. In addition, it provides virtual credit card usages that can be leveraged through its app that essentially offers its plans everywhere (including use through Apple Pay and Google Pay).

** Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

Affirm CEO Max Levchin recently confirmed that roughly 67% of his company’s customer base is Generation X and younger.

Analyzing Affirm’s consumer preference report, most consumers that favor 0% APR over interest loans with longer term limits are generally on the higher end of the FICO score. The stated hypothesis is that those lower on the credit score range were more apt to monitor their monthly budget and so would focus on the monthly payments. Those higher on the credit score range focus on the overall cost of the product. 

In addition, the report displayed that younger consumers were more likely to be interested in the product as they are not as likely to have disposable income.

Therefore, Affirm is likely targeting Generation X and younger, in addition to capturing those who are likely exhibiting high FICO score behaviors. Finally, it is interesting to note that “…every brand has unique shoppers with unique buyer behavior,” indicated that Affirm’s consumers may not have the same acceptance rate by brand or merchants may not have the same consumers across its brands. 

The size of the market it competes for will grow as consumers start embracing the Buy Now Pay Later model. In Europe and Australia approximately 20% of consumers leverage BNPL. Currently in the U.S., there was only 1% usage but that figure is rising fast as BNPL is being partnered with E-comm platforms.

** Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**

I found it difficult to interpret what technologies they used given the limited amount of time that I have invested learning technologies. Their introductory API developer blog went over my head. Narrowing my focus to how they integrate e-comm platforms, they had listed the following:

1.	Magento
2.	Shopify 
3.	WooCommerce

Double-clicking into Shopify, I see the following:

Shopify is an all-around e-commerce platform that allows you to build your own online store. This page describes the steps to integrate Affirm into the Shopify platform. After integrating Affirm, your Shopify site will:

•	Display Affirm promotional messaging
•	Offer Affirm as a payment option on the checkout page
•	Process Affirm charges in your order management system

Shopify is a platform that businesses use for its POS system. It works for both online and offline businesses. So it makes sense that Affirm would partner with Shopify and tie their technologies together. Shopify is also estimated to own a ~7% stake in Affirm.

Some of other technologies that they used were found through a Linkedin Search of a Senior Business Systems Manager jobs posting:
> Experience implementing and managing large Salesforce projects such as transitioning to Salesforce Lightning, implementation of CPQ, integration of sales stack tooling or scaling lead routing solutions.
> Experience with Salesforce CPQ, JavaScript, SQL, ETLs and other relevant coding languages

Extensive knowledge of coding is required to run their underlying technologies. 



## Landscape:

** What domain of the financial industry is the company in? **


Affirm is a lending company – It is competing with large credit card issuers, such as Synchrony Financial, and other types of Lenders. It is itself grouped into Buy Now Pay Later companies.

** What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? **

Over a 1/3 of US consumers have now used a BNPL product. The BNPL is projected to grow massively. 2025 is projected to have $680B in transaction volume, which is good for 13.25 CAGR growth rate from the $285 that was estimated in 2018. In Europe and Australia, BNPL is popular with a repeat usage of 20%. In this U.S. it is currently 1% but as consumers will likely follow the growth reflected in Europe and Australia.

## Results

** What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

Affirm is growing dramatically. Currently, it has partnered with 6,500 merchants and has serviced more than 6.0 million customers. From 2019 to 2020, its revenue grew by +95%. Interestingly, Peloton is currently their biggest revenue generator contributing approximately 30% of its revenue. Peloton has been doing well during COVID but Affirm is definitely in a risky position being tightly connected with Peloton. Affirm’s top 10 merchants contributes to 37% of it’s revenues so Peloton sticks out as a merchant that Affirm needs.  

Affirm’s recent IPO in January ’21 and immediate +100% increase in their stock price indicates that there is favorable momentum for Affirm to expand upon. 


** What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? **

The company’s gross merchandise volume, the most significant metric in the payments industry, increased by 77 per cent year-over-year. 

Roughly 64 per cent of Affrim’s loans in 2020 were given to repeat customers.

** How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? **

Affirm is not the #1 lender. Currently Bill Me Later/PayPal credit is the most commonly used BNPL service. Affirm came in #3 in the survey by Ascent (part of Motley Fool).

## Recommendations

** If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? **

Recommendations for Affirm are to ensure that they continue to grow their data pool by capturing more merchants and consumers. 
1.	Offer education services to further educate the consumer that Buy Now Pay Later payment models are conveniently available. One way to do this is reach-out to budget conscious consumers perhaps through a partnership with Mint.com. 
2.	Offer perks similar to credit cards for certain merchants, such as travel points or a discount, in order to gain further loyalty for a merchant. 

** Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? **

Offering perks to nascent small businesses will enable those business to increase loyalty if they don’t yet have a data capturing system on their consumers. Affirm’s model should be able to educate the merchant what its core consumers are like and then Affirm can use its existing pipes to offer the loyalty perks solution to the merchant. The synergy of such a program will enable Affirm to capture more data from consumers and also more revenue by being able to sell an additional product stream to merchants. 

** What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? **

There would have to be a portal built for consumers to leverage their perks. Additionally, Affirm would have to build separate dashboards for the merchants to be able to view how they are getting lifts and repeated visits from the new product. 

** Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? **

These technologies are appropriate because they leverage the existing pipes that Affirm has built to identify good consumers and habits. In addition, the perks portal would likely leverage technologies that have already been built by other loyalty based companies.
